==========================================

The <NAMETOBEDECIDED> package identifies regions of sound with and without frequency modulation, 
and allows custom measurements to be made on them. The sounds could be bird, bat, whale, human, artifical 
sounds - it should work :P. 

The basic workflow involves the tracking of a sounds frequency over time, and then calculating the 
rate of frequency modulation (FM), which is then used to decide which parts of a sound are frequency
modulated, and which are not. Here are some examples to show the capabilities of the package.
