Basic Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a set of relatively straightforward examples. Start with the bat call example!
The bat example is the only one with all the plots already rendered due to RAM limitations - sorry about that!
You can of course always download all the examples and run them as individual .py or Jupyter notebooks!

All of the frequency tracking in `itsfm` is based on generating what is called the Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (PWVD). To
get a `very` quick idea of how it compares to a spectrogram checkout the 'Segmenting with the PWVD method' example.
