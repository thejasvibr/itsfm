Basic Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a set of relatively straightforward examples. Start with the bat call example!
The bat example is the only one with all the plots already rendered due to RAM limitations
in readthedocs build - sorry about that! You can of course always download all the examples and run 
them as individual .py or Jupyter notebooks!
