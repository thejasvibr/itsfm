'Difficult' example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The <insertname> package was mainly designed keeping horseshoe bat calls 
in mind. These calls are high-frequency (>50kHz) and short (20-50ms) sounds
which are quite unique in their structure. Many of the default parameter
values reflect the original dataset. In fact, many of the default parameters
don't even work for some of the example datasets themselves!
It should be no surprise that unpredictable things happen when segmentation
and tracking is run with default values. 

This example will guide you through understanding the various parameters
that can be tweaked and what effect they actually have. It is not 
an exhaustive treatment of the implementation, but a 'lite' intro. For more
details of course, the original documentation should hopefully be helpful.

# signal region may be hard to capture because it keeps going above and 
# below the threshold - leading to many tiny 'Ã­slands'. Let's choose the 2ms `window_size` 
# because it doesn't fluctuate crazily and is also a relatively short time scale
# in comparison the the signal duration. -40 dB rms seems to be a sensible value 
# when we compare the approximate start and end times of the signal with the dB rms profile.

# Inspect initial outputs
# The CF-FM segmentation is *clearly* not correct. There's FM component recognised
# at all - how is this happening? The reason it's not happening is likely because
# the :code:`fmrate` has been misspecified or the frequency profile wasn't
# estimated correctly. Let's view the frequency profile first. 

output_inspector.visualise_frequency_profiles()

# %% 
# The cleaned frequency profile seems to somehow 'ignore' the 
# downward FM sweep in the call. Why is this happening? The
# 'flatness' in the cleaned frequency profile is likely 
# coming from the spike detection. Spikes in the 
# frequency profile are detected when the 'accelaration' of 
# (the 2nd derivative) the frequency profile increases beyond
# a threshold. Let's check out the accelaration profile 

output_inspector.visualise_accelaration()

# %% 
# The accelaration profile matches this suspicion. When a spikey 
# region is encountered in the frequency profile in the `pwvd`
# frequency tracking - it backs up a bit and extrapolates the 
# slope according to what's just behind the spikey region. 
# The 'length' of this backing up in seconds is decided by 
# the :code:`extrap_window`, which is short for extrapolation 
# window. Let's reduce the :code:`extrap_window` and see if 
# the frequency is tracked better.

# %% 
# So, we've managed to get a much better tracking by telling the 
# algorithm not to 'backup' too much to infer the trend
# the frequency profile was heading in. It's not perfect, but
# it does recover the fact that there is an FM region. Remember this
# issue came up because of the weird reflection of the CF part
# that is of comparable intensity as the actual FM part itself. 

# %% 
# How the CF-FM segmentation works
# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
#
# .. image:: ../_static/fmrate_workflow.png
#    :width: 66 %
#    :align: left
# CF-FM segmentation occurs through a multi step process. 
# First the instantaneous frequency of the signal is estimated at a sample-level
# resolution, the raw frequency profile - `raw_fp`. Then the `raw_fp` is refined 
# as it can be quite noisy because of well, noise, or abrupt changes in signal
# level across the sound. 
#
# Minor jumps will be corrected to give rise to the 
# cleaned frequency profile - `cleaned_fp`.  The `cleaned_fp` however, is 
# a very high-resolution look into the sound's frequency profile. Even though
# the temporal resolution is high, the spectral resolution is limited by the 
# size of the `pwvd_window` (refer to the original docs here). This limited
# spectral resolution means each sample will not have a unique value. For instance
# if the frequency of sound is increasing linearly with time, the `cleaned_fp`
# may actually look like steps going up. These 'steps' cause issues while calculating
# the rate of frequency modulation - `fmrate`, and so , the `cleaned_fp` is 
# actually downsampled and then upsampled by interpolation. This gives rise to 
# the fitted frequency profile - `fitted_fp`.
#
# The `fitted_fp` captures the local trends and doesn't have the step like nature of
# `cleaned_fp`. If we were to actually measure frequency modulation from `cleaned_fp`
# there'd be lots of 0 modulation regions and many very brief bursts of FM regions
# wherever a 'step' rose or dropped. Thanks to the sample-wise unique values in `fitted_fp` we can now 
# calculate the local variation in frequency modulation across the sound.
#
# Let's now check the frequency profiles once more

out_refined_inspector.visualise_frequency_profiles()

# %% 
# The raw and cleaned frequency profiles are very similar, though the 'cleanliness'
# in the `cleaned_fp` is visible especially because the frequency profile doesn'
# wildly jump around towards the end of the call. The `fitted_fp` also 
# closely matches the `cleaned_fp` though it seems to rise later and drop faster.
# This is because of the downsampling that happens to estimate the `fmrate`. 
# The rise time is a direct indicator of the downsampling factor, which samples
# the `cleaned_fp` at periodic intervals, and is thus called `sample_every`. The
# `sample_every` parameter defaults to 1% of the input signal duration. If the
# frequency profiles broadly match the actual call as seen coarsely on a spectrogram.


# %% 
# Step 2: Check the `fmrate` profile
# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# CF and FM parts of a call are segmented based on the rate of frequency modulation
# they show. The `fmrate` is a np.array with the estimated frequency modulation
# rate in **kHz/ms**. Yes, pay attention to the units, *it's not kHz/s, but kHz/ms*!
# Let's take a look at the FM rate profile for this sound. 

out_refined_inspector.visualise_fmrate()

# %% 
# Let's compare this fmrate profile with the final CF-FM segmentation. 

out_refined_inspector.visualise_cffm_segmentation()

# %%
# Something's odd -- even though the FM rate seems to be close to zero
# near the actual FM parts, parts of it are still being classified as FM!! What's happening. 
# Let's take a closer look at the FM rate profile, but zoom in so the y-axis is
# more limited. Let's also overlay the CF-FM segmentation results 
# over this. 
seg_out, call_parts, msmts = outputs_refined 
cf, fm, info = seg_out 

w,s = out_refined_inspector.visualise_fmrate()
s.set_ylim(0,5)
s.set_xlim(0.01,0.02)
w.plot()
itsfm.make_waveform(cf*4,fs)
itsfm.make_waveform(fm*4,fs)


# %% 
# From this you can clearly see that the FM part correspond to tiny peaks in 
# the `fmrate` which reach around 1 kHz/ms. It may of course be no surprise
# once you know the default `fmrate_threshold` is 1 kHz/ms. This rate doesn'
# make sense for bat call FM portions as they have much high frequency modulation
# rates. The easy way to estimate the relevant `fmrate_threshold` is to eyeball 
# the start and end frequencies of a call part and calculate the fm rate!

# %% 
# Step 3: Set a relevant `fmrate_threshold`
# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# For this example call any FM rate above 0.5kHz/ms will allow a sensible segmentation of the CF and FM
# parts. Lets set it more conservatively at 2kHz/ms, this will reduce false 
# positives. In general, for this particular call type, the FM sweep has an approximate
# rate of 5-6kHz/ms, and so we should definitely be able to pick up the FM region 
# with a threshold of 2kHz/ms. 

# add an additional keyword argument
keywords['fmrate_threshold'] = 2.0 # kHz/ms

# This tutorial exposed some of the messy details behind the 
# PWVD frequency tracking. In most cases, I hope you won't need to 
# think so much about the parameter choices. However, some basic
# playing around will definitely be necessary each time you're handling
# a new type of sound or recording type. Hopefully, this has either allowed 
# you to get a glimpse into the system. Do let me know if
